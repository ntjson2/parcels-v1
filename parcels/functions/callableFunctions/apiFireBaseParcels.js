/* // The timeoutSeconds option in the code snippet you provided is used to specify the maximum execution time for the Firebase function.
In this case, the timeoutSeconds value is set to 540, which means that the function has a maximum execution time of 540 seconds (or 9 minutes). If the function takes longer than this specified time to complete, it will be terminated by the Firebase Functions platform.
Setting a timeout for a function is important to prevent long-running or infinite loops from consuming excessive resources and potentially causing performance issues. It ensures that the function completes within a reasonable time frame and allows other functions to be executed in a timely manner.
By specifying a timeout value, you can control the execution time of your Firebase function and ensure that it doesn't exceed a certain threshold. This can be useful for functions that perform time-consuming operations or interact with external services that may have their own timeout limits.
It's worth noting that the maximum allowed value for timeoutSeconds is 540, as specified in the Firebase Functions documentation.
